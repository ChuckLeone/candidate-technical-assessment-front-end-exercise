# Candidate Technical Assessment Front-End Exercise
This is an exercise for candidates to complete who are applying for a Front-End Software Engineering position at Gaggle.

Included in the [gaggle-front-end-engineer-assignment.zip](./gaggle-front-end-engineer-assignment.zip) you will find a wireframe (index.html) with three views. Given the assests provided, build out the views. It is fairly vague, so if you have questions you are encouraged you to ask. We are not only gauging how you code but also how you interact with stakeholders to determine the requirements of an assigned task.

Please have this completed within 1 week of receiving the technical assessment email. If you can't make that deadline please let us know and we can make arrangements where possible. We expect you will commit your completed assignment to GitHub and send us a link to the repository when complete. Then use the scheduling link in the original email to schedule time for Gaggle to review with you.
